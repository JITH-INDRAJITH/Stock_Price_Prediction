# Stock_Price_Prediction
# Introduction
In today's data-driven world, forecasting the behavior of the stock market has become increasingly important for investors, traders, and financial analysts. Time series forecasting techniques are commonly employed to predict various aspects of the stock market, such as opening and closing prices, trading volumes, and more.

In this Project, we will focus on predicting the average stock price of a stock exchange using historical data spanning from the year 2000 to 2021. We will employ several forecasting models and evaluate their performance using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. The primary objectives of this case study are:

1.)Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the stock price data.
2.)Build ARIMA/SARIMA models, both with and without exogenous variables, for stock price prediction.
3.)Utilize the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting stock prices.
4.)Implement an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, a type of deep learning model, for stock price prediction.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used for this case study is named "YahooFinance.csv". It contains historical average stock price data of a stock exchange for the time period ranging from 2000 to 2021. The dataset comprises the following columns:

Date: The date of the stock price data.
Average Price: The average stock price for the corresponding date.
# Methodology
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution and trends of the average stock prices over time.
Identify any seasonality or trends present in the data.
# ARIMA/SARIMA Models:
Build Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models for stock price prediction.
Experiment with different orders of differencing, seasonal components, and model parameters.
Evaluate the models using RMSE.
# Facebook Prophet Model:
Utilize the Facebook Prophet library, which is specifically designed for time series forecasting with daily observations that display patterns on different time scales.
Train the Prophet model on the historical stock price data and forecast future prices.
Assess the forecast accuracy using RMSE.
# LSTM Model:
Implement a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for stock price prediction.
Preprocess the data and structure it into sequences suitable for training the LSTM model.
Train the LSTM model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data using RMSE.
# Conclusion
In this Project, we have explored various techniques for forecasting stock prices using time series analysis and deep learning. By comparing the performance of different models, we can determine which approach provides the most accurate predictions for the given dataset. This case study serves as a practical guide for utilizing different forecasting methods to predict stock prices, which can be valuable for investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions in the stock market.
